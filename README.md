# Maze Environment and Value Iteration

## Description

This repository contains code for a simple maze environment and a Python implementation of the value iteration algorithm for reinforcement learning. The goal of the agent is to navigate from a starting state to a goal state within the maze, while maximizing rewards and avoiding obstacles.

## Files

- value_iteration.py: This file implements the value iteration algorithm to solve the maze problem.
- requirements.txt: This file lists the required Python libraries.
- README.md: This file (you're reading it now!).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

1. Run the value iteration algorithm:
   ```bash
   python value_iteration.ipynb
   
3. View the optimal policy and value function plots.

## Customization

- Modify the maze structure.
- Adjust the reward function and transition probabilities.
- Explore different reinforcement learning algorithms in value_iteration.ipynb
