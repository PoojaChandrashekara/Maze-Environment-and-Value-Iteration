# Maze Environment and Value Iteration

## Description

This repository contains code for a simple maze environment and a Python implementation of the value iteration algorithm for reinforcement learning. The goal of the agent is to navigate from a starting state to a goal state within the maze, while maximizing rewards and avoiding obstacles.

## Files

value_iteration.py: This file implements the value iteration algorithm to solve the maze problem.
requirements.txt: This file lists the required Python libraries.
README.md: This file (you're reading it now!).
